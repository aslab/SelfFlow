## Purpose

**SelfFlow** addresses the flow of self-knowledge between intelligent autonomous agents in teaming contexts.

The project does not target robot teamwork or collaboratio, the focus theme is the **transfer of self-knowledge** to be used for cooperative work of heterogeneous robot teams.

## Basic Scenario

An UGV is searching and collecting tennis balls in a tennis court (or other more cluttered environment to make the task harder). It has difficulties finding the balls due to limited vision capability (e.g. it only has short-ranged ultrasound or close cameras).

An UAV enters the scene. UAV and UGV interchanges info on tasks and capabilities. The UGV learns about the capability of imaging of the drone. It asks for collaboration in searching for balls. The UAV agrees and collaborates in the task.


## Work

The work is to devise a representation/engine/protocol to store, exploit and interchange self-models for robots to cooperate.

- Investigate literature on heterogeneous robot teaming
- Investigate literature on capability representation
- Investigate literature on robot sel-awareness
- Investigate literature on robot mutual knowledge
- Define the self--knowledge that is of relevance
- Do SK interchange in planning-time/real-time
